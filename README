Apache-HTTunnel
===============

Apache::HTTunnel is a universal HTTP tunnel that allows the transport
of any TCP/IP protocol over HTTP. It is designed to allow people
behind firewalls/proxies to access non-HTTP services.

It is loaded into the Apache web server using mod_perl. The client
module (HTTunnel::Client) or script (/usr/bin/httunnel) can then be
used to setup the actual tunnel(s). See Client/README for more information
on using the client components.

Note: Apache::HTTunnel works only on UNIX-type platforms, more specifically
those that support the sendmsg(2)/recvmsg(2) API.



INSTALLATION

- To install this module type the following:

     % perl Makefile.PL
     % make
     % make test
     % make install

     Note 1: Apache::Test is used in the test suite. If the test suite cannot 
             find your Apache web server, you may want to try one of the 
             following (see the Apache::TestMM documentation for more details):

                % perl Makefile.PL -apxs /path/to/apxs
                % perl Makefile.PL -httpd /path/to/httpd

- Generate the sample configuration file (see the Apache::HTTunnel documentation
  for more information on the available configuration file options):

     % perl -MApache::HTTunnel=sample_config > /etc/httpd/conf/perl_httunnel.conf

- Restart Apache (see the HTTunnel::Client documentation for more information
  on using the client components to setup a tunnel):

     % service httpd restart

- To install only the client portion, see Client/README.
