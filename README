Apache-HTTunnel
===============

Apache::HTTunnel is a universal HTTP tunnel that allows the transport
of any TCP or UDP protocol over HTTP. It is designed to allow people
behind firewalls/proxies to access non-HTTP services.

It is loaded into the Apache web server using mod_perl. The client
module (HTTunnel::Client) or script (/usr/bin/httunnel) can then be
used to setup the actual tunnel(s). See Client/README for more information
on using the client components.

Note: Apache::HTTunnel works only on UNIX-type platforms, more specifically
those that support the sendmsg(2)/recvmsg(2) API.



INSTALLATION

- To install this module type the following:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % make test
    % make install

    Note 1: Apache::Test is used in the test suite. If the test suite cannot 
            find your Apache web server, you may want to try one of the 
            following (see the Apache::TestMM documentation for more details):

               % perl Makefile.PL -apxs /path/to/apxs
               % perl Makefile.PL -httpd /path/to/httpd

- A sample configuration file should have been created for you during the 
  installation and placed in /etc/httpd/conf/perl_httunnel.conf. If this is
  not satisfactory, you can move/copy it or generate a new one like this:

    % perl -MApache::HTTunnel=sample_config > /etc/httpd/conf/perl_httunnel.conf

  See the Apache::HTTunnel documentation for more information on the available
  configuration file options. 

  Note: Some of the settings in the sample configuration file may be more 
  permisive than you would like. MAKE SURE YOU REVIEW THE SAMPLE CONFIGURATION 
  FILE BEFORE PROCEEDING!

- Restart Apache (see the HTTunnel::Client documentation for more information
  on using the client components to setup a tunnel):

     % service httpd restart

- To install only the client portion, see Client/README.
